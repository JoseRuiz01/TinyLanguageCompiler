# Tiny Language Processor 

This repository contains the complete development of a language processor for the **Tiny** programming language, created as part of the **Language Processors** course at *Universidad Complutense de Madrid*.

## 游닂 Project Overview

The project involves designing and implementing a full compiler for the Tiny language, starting from lexical analysis and ending in code generation for a stack-based abstract machine.

## 游댢 Project Phases

### 1. Lexical Analysis
- Definition of lexical classes for Tiny(0) and Tiny
- Regular expressions specification
- Transition diagrams for token recognition

### 2. Syntax Analysis
- Manual parser for Tiny(0) using recursive descent
- Top-down and bottom-up parsers for Tiny
- Grammar conditioning and director sets

### 3. AST Construction
- Abstract syntax specification via function signatures
- Attribute grammar for AST construction
- Implementation-ready grammar transformations
- Token stream printing

### 4. Final Compiler Stages
- Type checking procedures
- Memory allocation strategy
- Instruction set for a target abstract machine (code-p)
- Labeling and code generation logic

## 游늭 Structure
The repository is organized by phase, each containing detailed documentation, code, and diagrams for its components.
